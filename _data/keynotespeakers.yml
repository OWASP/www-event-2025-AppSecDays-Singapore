  bio: >- 
        Vivek Ramachandran is a security researcher, book author, speaker-trainer, and serial entrepreneur with over two decades of experience in offensive cybersecurity. He is currently the founder of SquareX, building a browser-native security product focused on detecting, mitigating, and threat-hunting web attacks against enterprise users and consumers. Prior to that, he was the founder of Pentester Academy (acquired in 2021), which has trained thousands of customers from government agencies, Fortune 500 companies, and enterprises from over 140+ countries. Before that, Vivek’s company built an 802.11ac monitoring product sold exclusively to defense agencies.
        Vivek discovered the Caffe Latte attack, broke WEP Cloaking, conceptualized enterprise Wi-Fi Backdoors, and created Chellam (Wi-Fi Firewall), WiMonitor Enterprise (802.11ac monitoring), Chigula (Wi-Fi traffic analysis via SQL), Deceptacon (IoT Honeypots), among others. He is the author of multiple five-star-rated books in offensive cybersecurity, which have sold thousands of copies worldwide and have been translated into multiple languages.
        He has been a speaker/trainer at top security conferences such as Blackhat USA, Europe and Abu Dhabi, DEFCON, Nullcon, Brucon, HITB, Hacktivity, and others. Vivek’s work in cybersecurity has been covered in Forbes, TechCrunch, and other popular media outlets.
        In a past life, he was one of the programmers of the 802.1x protocol and Port Security in Cisco’s 6500 Catalyst series of switches. He was also one of the winners of the Microsoft Security Shootout contest held in India among a reported 65,000 participants. He has also published multiple research papers in the field of DDoS, ARP Spoofing Detection, and Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection Systems. In 2021, he was awarded an honorary title of Regional Director of Cybersecurity by Microsoft for a period of three years, and in 2024 he joined the BlackHat Arsenal Review Board.

        The web browser is the most used enterprise application, but the least protected.  For almost two decades Secure Web Gateways, as part of SASE/SSE framework, served as the primary defence against web threats by monitoring the network layer.  However, as browsers have evolved into complex, OS likeenvironments and web applications have grown in intricacies, Secure Web Gateways have become outdated and ineffective.  In this keynote, we will expose the inherent architectural flaws of Secure Web Gateways, particularly their inability to defent against modern web attacks like Last Mile Reassembly attacks. The argument is clear, Secure Web Gateways are no longer Viable as the guardian of the web.  The Future of Web Security lies in browser-native solutions that operate directly within the browser, leveraging rich browser data to drive advanced web attack detection algorithims.

        In an era where digital transformation is accelerating, our future is being written, coded, by the decisions we make today. but securing this future requires more than just traditional security measures. It demands the ingenuity of hackers and the power of community-driven collaboration. This keynote explores how the hacker mindset and community innovation are key to embedding security into the very DNA of our digital infrastructure. By leveraging the creativity, curiosity, and collaborative spirit of the hacking community, we can craft a resilient digital future where security is not an afterthought but a fundamental element. This talk will challenge you to rethink how we approach security, empowering hackers and communities to shape a safer, more secure digital world - one line of code at a time.
